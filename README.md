
# ErasmusFinder 

ErasmusFinder was my final degree project.

An app built with a backend in NodeJS + Express and a frontend made with Angular. The idea of the application was to create a social network for travelers who want to exchange languages with other people in their area (or not). It includes a login and registration form, a map section where you can see users near you, and an events section.

##INSTRUCTIONS

The database contains the names of the countries in English, so when registering a user, in the country of origin field, it auto-completes with the country name in English. 
The same applies to the map view when searching for any country.
